# CS-370-Module-8-Journal


    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project was able to use machine learning to enable a "pirate" agent to become progressively better at finding hidden tresure within a maze. The agent starts out by not understanding much at all, and bumps into walls over and over. The agent eventually trains for long enough that it finds the treasure almost every iteration. The pirate also finds the end goal faster and faster over time. The Q-learning algorithm was a good choice for the agent because it allows the agent to use what it has learned about the past in order to make better decisions for the future. The agent also is able to explore part of the time so that it can look for paths that may be more optimal than the paths it currently has. 


    
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are people who are able to take a problem or request, and use plans and software to fix those problems, or bring those things to life. These things matter because in the age of technology, being able to improve efficiency and the quality of life is something that is absolutely possible as a computer scientist. 

        
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching problems as a computer scientists starts off with a problem, with then goes to planning, which then goes to implementing. These stages can vary in length, but generally, understanding the problem and having a really strong plan for how the problem will be addressed is half of the battle. Attacking a problem without a plan in computer science makes the implementation stage extremely difficult. The plan that was needed for this project was outlined very well, so meeting that problem with the planning and implementation was very straightforward. 

        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are: to keep the users safe and at ease while at the same time, improving their quality of life through things like efficiency. The end user may want to see things that are relevant to what they like to see, but invading their privacy to meet this need would be considered unethical. Creating systems that are designed to know who you are or what you may like may be considered innovative, but not if they are racially biased. With all good things in technology, things like risk should be evaluated constantly. The end user and organization should be the ones you are trying to make happy, not for money, but for experience and quality of life.
